* Structured to support dimensional analysis and KPI calculations.

  
# Tools
* Power BI Desktop
* Power Query
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* Excel


# Insights
* Revenue peaked in 2023 but declined noticeably in 2024 despite stable performance in most sales dimensions.
* Customer Segment performance shows SME and Retail leading, with Corporate slightly lower in average revenue.


# Data Storytelling Framework
* The company has shown stable performance across sales reps, product categories, customer segments, and regions over recent years.
* Despite this stability, annual revenue in 2024 declined significantly after reaching its highest point in 2023, without any major drops in other performance indicators.
* Why did revenue decrease in 2024 despite stable metrics across the sales structure? What part of the funnel or market shift caused this drop?.
* The decline is likely due to changes in customer conversion behavior rather than internal sales performance. Since deal size, category performance, and regional distribution remained stable, the issue appears to be within the sales funnel, particularly in converting opportunities into closed deals.

# Recommendations
* Analyze Conversion Rate by quarter to detect patterns behind the decline.
* Review the Opportunity, Won stage to identify leakage in the funnel.
* Assess pricing and discounting differences between 2023 and 2024 to determine competitive impact.
* Increase marketing focus on lower‑performing segments, especially Corporate.
  

# Conclusion
* The dashboard highlights a significant revenue decline in 2024 driven by funnel level issues rather than operational performance. 
* These findings help guide strategic decisions to improve conversions and sustain revenue growth.
